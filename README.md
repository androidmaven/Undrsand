# CURRENTLY, UNDRSTAND CAN DO THE FOLLOWING:
Through the power of Vision Machine learning, you can use your camera to extract any text and find its meaning. Place your camera on the word/sentence/block, undrstand automatically captures and extract the text. Afterwards through the Natural Langage Machine learning, undrstand can extract key words from a block of text, and then provide accurate dictionary meaning and thesarus. This text can also be made to speak out through the power of Google Text to Speech.

# Technologies and frameworks used.
1. Vision Machine learning
2. Natural Language.
3. Google Text to Speech
4. Camera API
5. WebView supported by chrome.

#DEV FRAMEWORK USED - MVP


# The 3-tier features Undrstand will have
1. Understand aims to simplify reading process, by explaning up a block of text/sentences, extracting the keywords and automatically giving their dictionary meaning, while also providing extra links provided by google. All through your camera

2. It also provides easy text to speech, and translation of sentence.

3. Another facinating thing is the ability of transcribing audio files into text. This enables converting of audio books into plain text, and the easy translating any language of audio into your desired language text.

# Further updates will be made. If you interested in contributing to this project, kindly reach out!
